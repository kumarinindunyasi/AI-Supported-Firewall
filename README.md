# Intelligent Network Firewall

## Project Description
This project implements an intelligent network firewall that leverages artificial intelligence to monitor network traffic and detect potential threats in real-time. The firewall classifies IP addresses into whitelists and blacklists, allowing trusted sources while blocking malicious ones. It is specifically designed to protect against various types of attacks, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The system continuously learns and adapts to new threats, enhancing overall network security.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the firewall logic and AI model.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, especially in handling CSV files containing network traffic data.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing that assists in data processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for creating and training machine learning models to predict malicious IP addresses.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks used to build and train neural networks for more advanced AI predictions (if applicable).
- **CSV**: Format used for data storage and manipulation, facilitating easy data reading and writing.

## File Execution Order
1. **filter.py**: 
   - This file is executed first to process raw network traffic data. It reads a CSV file containing the data, selects relevant columns, calculates data rates, and flags potential DDoS attacks. The processed data is then saved in a new CSV file for further analysis.

2. **train.py**: 
   - Next, this file is used to train the AI model. It reads the processed data generated by `filter.py`, cleans and transforms it, and splits it into training and testing sets. The neural network model is created and trained using this data. After training, the model and label encoders are saved for future predictions.

3. **predict.py**: 
   - Once the model is trained, this file is executed to make predictions on new network traffic data. It uses the trained AI model and encoders to classify IP addresses as malicious or benign. Predictions are added to the blacklist and whitelist as necessary.

4. **firewall.py**: 
   - Finally, this script implements the firewall logic. It uses the predictions made by `predict.py` to monitor network traffic in real-time. It checks incoming packets against the whitelist and blacklist, allowing or blocking them based on the AI model's predictions. The firewall also detects and mitigates potential threats dynamically.

## Conclusion
This intelligent network firewall project combines real-time monitoring with AI-driven predictions to enhance network security. By effectively managing IP addresses and blocking malicious traffic, it provides a robust defense against various cyber threats.
